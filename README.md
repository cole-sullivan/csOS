# Cole Sullivan's Operating System (csOS)

## Installation:

On a freshly installed Arch-based distribution as root, run the following:

```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cole-sullivan/csOS/main/install.sh
sh install.sh
```

That's it.

## What is csOS?

csOS is a minimal terminal-and-vim-based Linux environment that can be
installed on any Arch-based Linux distribution. It was constructed specifically for
my machine and setup (a ThinkPad running Arch Linux), however, it should work
on any machine running an Arch-based distribution.

## Inspiration

The installation script was built from Luke Smith's [LARBS script](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS).
